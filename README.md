# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

In this module, we assisted a data analyst named Maria in conducting analysis on a variety of schools in a school district. We looked at several variables relating to each school, such as the funding each school is provided and the average grades of students in the school. With the analysis that we produced in this module, the school board will be better equiped to make decisions for how to manage these schools. The analysis we provided can help the school boards understand which schools are scoring the lowest on certain subjects and therefore which schools need more assistance to ensure better outcomes for all students. We also looked at how funding can affect the average grades of students at each school, which will help the school boards understand which schools require more funding and whether or not increasing funding can directly improve student outcomes.

## Results:

The Average Math Score changed from 79.0 to 78.9, the Average Reading Score was unchanged, % Passing Math changed from 75.0 to 74.8, and % Passing Reading changed from 85.8 to 85.7.
